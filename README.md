Geometry Dash

Replication of Geometry Dash that relies on ACM graphics. To run, first setup the included acm.jar file as a library (setup depends on your IDE). Then build and run the project. You will be asked to maximize the window before viewing the start screen. To start playing, hit the play button in the center. Use spacebar to jump and p to pause. Have fun!
